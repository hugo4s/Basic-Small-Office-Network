# Setting up a Simple LAN

This project consists of creating a basic local area network (LAN) to allow communication between devices. Using tools such as Cisco Packet Tracer, we set up a simple network with PCs and a switch. I added a server to host a basic website and test access through a browser.

## Objectives

1. Connect 3 PCs and 1 switch.
2. Configure static IP addresses on the PCs.
3. Test connectivity between the PCs with the `ping` command.
4. Add a server to host a basic website and test access through a browser.
